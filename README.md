# Advance Data Structure Lab Programs
## Program 1:
Write a program to implement the following list: An ordinary Doubly Linked List requires space for two address fields to store the addresses of previous and next nodes. A memory efficient version of Doubly Linked List can be created using only one space for address field with every node. This memory efficient Doubly Linked List is called XOR Linked List or Memory Efficient as the list uses bitwise XOR operation to save space for one address. In the XOR linked list, instead of storing actual memory addresses, every node stores the XOR of addresses of previous and next nodes.
Implement a function to insert a new node at the beginning and at the end of the list. 
## Program 2:
Write a program to perform insertion, deletion and searching operations on a skip list.
consider the maximum number of levels to be log n where 'n' is the number of nodes in the list
## Program 3:
Given a boolean 2D matrix, find the number of islands. A group of connected 1's forms an island. 
For example, the below matrix contains 5 islands
{1, 1, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0, 0, 1}, {1, 0, 0, 1, 1}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, {1, 0, 1, 0, 1}.
 A cell in the 2D matrix can be connected to 8 neighbours. Use disjoint sets to implement the above scenario.
## Program 4:
Write a program to perform insertion and deletion operations on AVL trees
## Program 5:
Write a program to perform insertion and deletion operations on an 2-3 tree
## Program 6:
Write a program to implement insertion operation on a B-tree.
## Program 7:
Write a program to implement insertion operation on a red black tree. During insertion, appropriately show how recolouring or rotation operation is used
